Note: These instructions are written for people not versed in running this file from the terminal. If you know how to do that, read the README. 

Intructions to use this program:

The program takes in a .csv file as its input. So, on the sheet you need to go to File > Download as > .csv  to download this file as a .csv file. 

Once downloaded, rename it as RawFile.csv. If it's windows, the .csv is hidden so make sure to not to rename it to RawFile.csv.csv. 

Then download my code and put it into the same folder.

For MAC: Enter terminal (You need to go into utilities to find it).
		 To look at the files and folders in your present directory, type "ls". 
		 Use cd "<Name of Folder>" to enter into another folder.
		 Use "cd" to get back to root folder.
		 Use "cd .." to get back to previous folder.
		 Using these commands navigate to the folder where you have downloaded your file and my code.

For PC: Open Command Prompt (You need to go into start menu to find it).
		 To look at the files and folders in your present directory, type "dir". 
		 Use cd "<Name of Folder>" to enter into another folder.
		 Use "cd" to get back to root folder.
		 Use "cd .." to get back to previous folder.
		 Using these commands navigate to the folder where you have downloaded your file and my code.

Then type "python GoOverseas.py".

If the code executed without error, that same folder should now have separate .txt files for each person's reponse.

You can close the command prompt/terminal without any further instructions.

Hope this helps,
